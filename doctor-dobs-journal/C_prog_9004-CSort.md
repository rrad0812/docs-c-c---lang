## CSORT: A Saga of a Sort - Al Stevens

Those of you with mainframe experience know that a common and indispensable utility program in that environment is the file sort program. Many batch applications involve the generation of reports taken from data files that you maintain in sequences other than the sequence needed for the report at hand. I remember the two- and three-way tape sorts on the IBM 1401 from as far back as 1961. It would have been unthinkable to try to design a system without one.

The Mainframe Tape Sort

Here's how such a sort works in the typical tape-drive configuration of yore. You need at least four tape drives to run a two-way sort. The unsorted file starts out on the first tape drive, and the other three have scratch reels of tape. A file of parameters (usually on a control card) tells the sort program the size of the file's records and the location, length, and sequence (ascending or descending) of each of the fields to be sorted.

Pass One, the Input Pass -- The sort program reads as many records into memory as the CPU can hold and sorts them in an array. Then it writes the sorted block of records to the third tape drive. Next, it reads and sorts another block of records and writes that block to the fourth drive, then the next block to the third, and so on until all the input records have been read. Drives 3 and 4 now each contain multiple blocks of individually sorted records, and this is the end of the first pass.

During the first pass, the block size is restricted to the amount of memory that is available. Block sizes double during subsequent passes because each block is in sequence, and the program reads them a record at a time to perform the merge.

Pass Two, the Merge-down Pass -- The computer operator replaces the input tape on drive 1 with a fourth scratch tape, and the sort program merges the first block from drive 3 with the first block from drive 4, writing the merged block onto drive 1. Then it would merge the next blocks from drives 3 and 4 onto drive 2. This flip-flop continues until all the blocks from drives 3 and 4 are merged into drives 1 and 2, which together now contain half as many blocks as 3 and 4. (The old-timers among my readers are beginning to get bored.)

Pass Three, the Output Pass -- The merges continue back and forth with each pass reducing the number of ordered blocks by half and doubling the size of each block until at the final pass there is only one block on either drive 1 or 3, and this tape contains the sorted file, which can be read by the application.

Sordid Data on Micros

When I began working with microcomputers in the mid-seventies I looked for the standard sort utility program that I thought would come with operating systems, and I found none. The first significant application I wrote for an IMSAI 8080 needed file sorting, and a search turned up a CP/M program called "QSORT," but I was surprised to learn that it was difficult to find what had always been an indispensable utility program.

With the PC and MS-DOS came the SORT filter program, but it has three serious limitations: It can only sort as many records as will fit into 64K, it can sort only one field of the file's records, and, being a filter, it works only with text files.

The In-line Sort

So much for the file sort utility program. Now let's consider the in-line sort feature. Anyone who has programmed in many computer languages has accumulated some favorite features about each one. The ideal personal language would have all those features wrapped into one. Of course, when you try to build a language with everyone's favorite features, you get a committee-designed language -- you get ADA, perhaps. The perfect personal language would be so extensible that each of us could design his own syntax and data types, plugging in the features we treasure and leaving out the ones we do not. The flaw in that approach is that no one could read anyone else's code, and so, instead of each of us building a personal ideal language, we ebb to the committee approach, standards emerge, and we strive to conform.

As a full-time C programmer and writer, I often think of language features in terms of the features I liked about languages past that C does not have. For example, the string functions of Basic are missing in C. Cobol's MOVE CORRESPONDING would be handy in C where the C structure assignment would assign only those members that have the same names. You can add both of these features to C by building appropriate C++ classes if you are using the C++ extensions to C, and so the dubious realm of the customized language looms again in the near future.

There is one feature I liked about Cobol that you can build in traditional C without extending the language other than with a few functions. That feature is the SORT verb and it is relevant to this month's rambling.

A Cobol program can pass records to the SORT verb one at time and then later retrieve those records in the sorted sequence. There are several advantages to this technique. One is that the program does not need to prepare an unsorted file, exit to a sort utility program, and then execute a third program to process the sorted file. You can form each unsorted record from one or more sources just prior to sending it off to be sorted, and you can transform the sorted records into another format before doing anything with them. No intermediate file of uniquely formatted records is involved.

The C qsort function is similar to this approach except that it sorts an in-memory array, and so all your data records must fit into memory. A true in-line sort will accept as many records, one at a time, as you want to give it, and will return those records to you, one at a time, in sorted order.

So now we have defined two requirements missing from the C language and the microprocessor operating system environment. Why, after ten solid years of micro use, are these features not standard? Obviously, they are not widely needed for some reason, and that reason is, I guess, that the personal, inexpensive nature of the PC has redefined the way we design systems. Most PC programs today are interactive. If they involve multiple sequences of data files, they use indexed database managers or higher-level DBMS languages that deal with sorting in their own ways. OK, so most of the time we do not need a sort program or an in-line sort. But what about the few times when we do? Nothing else will do.

About five years ago, I tackled this problem by writing a C language in-line sort function for some programs for a video tape store. Later I used it as the sort engine for a stand-alone sort program that sorts disk files. I used pre-ANSI Aztec C for the IBM-PC and published the code in a book (C Development Tools for the IBM PC, Brady Books) in 1986. Since then I have reused that program many times in circumstances where I might have chosen a more accessible but less appropriate solution had I not already had this little sort program. Now that the ANSI standard definition of C is in place, it's time to update that program, so this month we promote it to the standard and publish it here.

CSORT

What follows is CSORT, a sorting facility that you can use from within your programs or from the command line. Although I developed it to use in CP/M systems and later in MS-DOS, it is not wired to either of those environments and should easily port to another platform where a standard C compiler is available.

The CSORT project has two parts, the in-line sort and the file sort program. To use the in-line sort in a C program, you describe the characteristics of the records to be sorted and send them, one at a time, off to the sort process. After you have sent the last of the records, you send a NULL and go about your business. When you are ready for the records in the sorted sequence, you call the sort program and it returns the records, one for each call. After it has returned the last of the sorted records, it returns a NULL. Your program is essentially the polar ends of a three-phase pipe.

You and CSORT pass records back and forth with pointers. CSORT makes a copy of the record you pass it, so you can safely reuse the space the record occupied. CSORT expects you to do the same because it might reuse the record space that is pointed to be a previous pointer it returned.

CSORT requires that you sort fixed-length records, but the records themselves do not need to be in text format. The sort comparison uses the strnicmp function to compare fields, so they do not need to be null-terminated.

The CSORT API

Following is the application program interface for CSORT. Listing One , page 144, is CSORT.H, which contains several control values for the sort. The NOFLDS global value specifies the maximum number of fields that can be involved in the sort of the record. The MOSTMEM and LEASTMEM values control the appropriation of a buffer from the heap for sorting. MOSTMEM is the amount you try for, and LEASTMEM is the least amount you will accept. I have them set to work within a small-model program on the PC.

Here are the prototypes and descriptions of the CSORT API functions.

int init_sort(struct s_prm *prms); To sort records, you must describe them. The s_prm structure contains the definition of the records to be sorted. It is defined in CSORT.H. You will declare the structure and initialize it as follows. Assign the record length to the rc_len member. The s_fld array of substructures will contain entries for each of the fields to be sorted. The s_fld.f_pos member contains the record position for the field. This value is relative to one. If there are fewer than NOFLDS fields, the terminal entry in this array will contain a zero value for this member. The s_fld.f_len member is the length of the field. The s_fld.ad member is the character "a" if the field is to be collated in ascending sequence and "d" if it is to be collated in descending sequence. The first field in the array is the major sort field; the last is the minor; all others are intermediate. So, if you need records in, for example, division number, department number, and employee number sequence, you will define the fields in that order in the array. With the array properly initialized, call the init_sort function. If the sort may proceed -- if enough memory is available -- the function returns zero. Otherwise it returns -1.

void sort(char *rcd); With the sort program properly initialized through init_sort, you may send records to be sorted by calling the sort function once for each record. Pass a pointer to the record, and the sort function will make a copy of the record. After you have passed the last record, pass a NULL pointer. This tells the sort function to finish the sort and prepare to return sorted records.

char *sort_op(void); To retrieve sorted records, call the sort_op function. Each call to it will return a pointer to the next record in the sorted sequence. After the last record comes back, the sort_op returns a NULL pointer.

void sort_stats(void); This function displays some of the values used in the sort function.

The FILESORT Program

Listing Two, page 144, is FILESORT.C, a program that uses the CSORT API to implement a stand-alone file sort program. You run it by entering the filename, record length, and field parameters on the command line. It uses the API in the manner just described.

CSORT Internals

Listing Three, page 144, is CSORT.C, which contains the in-line sort functions. The first function to discuss is init_sort, which you call to initiate sorting. It calls appr_mem to allocate a block of memory in which to sort, initializes the sorting parameters, and returns.

The sort function accepts records to sort from the calling application. At first it simply copies them into the buffer, one after the other. When the buffer is full, the sort function calls the standard qsort function to sort the records in the buffer. This becomes a block of sorted records, also called here a "sequence." The dumpbuff function writes them to the sort work file. CSORT uses only one sort work file, unlike the tape sorts we discussed earlier. Because this program uses disk files, and because direct record addressing is possible, we do not need to maintain multiple, serial devices for the blocks of sorted records after the fashion of a streamer tape device.

When the calling application sends a NULL pointer to the sort function, it sorts the final sequence, writes it to the work file, and calls prep_merge to prepare for when the caller wants sorted records. The merge divides the sort work buffer into many miniature buffers, one for each sequence that was generated by the sort function. These buffers contain two or, usually, more records. If and while the number of sequences is high enough to prevent the buffer from being segmented this way, prep_merge uses the merge function to merge groups of two sequences into one, halving the number of sequences and doubling their sizes.

When the number of sequences is low enough that each one can contribute at least two records in the sort buffer, the merge and prep_merge functions are done.

The calling application calls sort_op to get sorted records. The sort_op function looks at the first record in each buffer segment to find the lowest record. It bumps that segment's record pointer and returns a pointer to the record it found. When it exhausts a buffer segment, it reads more records from the associated sequence on the sort work file. When all the segments are empty, the application has read the last sorted record, and the sort program signals that it is done by returning a NULL pointer.

TopSpeed C

Last year I reported that I had seen a demo of the announced TopSpeed C compiler from Jensen & Partners International. The product is shipping now, and is a full-featured ANSI-conforming compiler with integrated editor, compiler, linker, and debugger. I used it to upgrade CSORT to the ANSI specification and can offer these first impressions. Be advised that I have not yet used TSC to build a significant system from scratch, so these judgments are preliminary. I think you will like this product. After reading and following the installation procedures, I used the books only once during the project, and that was to learn the format for the MAKE project file. Everything else is neatly supported with comprehensive help windows and intuitive menus.

TSC has a number of features that I haven't used yet but surely will. They have built a DOS equivalent of the OS/2 dynamic link library (DLL). You can build programs that link to their libraries at run time. There is a post-mortem debugger, an assembler and disassembler, a program profiler, and support for DOS Windows and OS/2 Presentation Manager program development.

TSC has a few things I'd change. Their version of the interrupt function type has a severe disability. You cannot call an interrupt function directly or through a function pointer. This prevents you from chaining intercepted interrupts and renders TSC ineffectual as a TSR development compiler -- unless you want to compensate by using assembly language.

Although TSC has the _AX, _BX, etc. pseudoregisters of Turbo C, they do not support _FLAGS, which makes their use in interrupt service routine programming even more difficult.

The tables of contents and indexes in most of the documents do not agree with the actual page numbers. This is an unacceptable lapse in quality control for any documentation effort. I forgive that lapse only because the online documentation is so good.

TSC tends to leave my cursor other than the way it found it, and it leaves all manner of what appears to be temporary work files scattered about my source directory. These quirks are annoying at best.

One last gripe, then I'll relax. I rejoiced when I saw the WATCH utility. It is a really neat TSR, tossed in for good measure, that you can use to monitor the calls your program makes to DOS, an essential tool for systems programmers. I do a lot of programming in the Novell NetWare local area network environment, and NetWare API calls are supersets of the DOS INT 0 x 21. To my dismay, I learned that WATCH only watches calls that you select from its list of known DOS calls, and there seems to be no way to tell it to watch the Novell superset list. Rats. Another idea well conceived, poorly built.

If it seems that I am overly critical it is because these are the things I found that I think you should know about. There may be others, but, as I said, my use of TSC has been limited so far. All that aside, I like the product and do not hesitate to recommend it. It is in great shape for the first version of any software product and will surely improve with newer versions. The PC programmer has a dilemma. There are several excellent compilers to choose from. By now, there will have been benchmarks and reviews and, I am sure, you still will not know what to do.

(The title of this month's column is a paraphrase of that of the Bill Mauldin book, A Sort of a Saga. His book has nothing to do with C or programming, but Mauldin's cartoons and writings and that book in particular are timeless and were major influences in my young life.)
